    "# 3D Variable Extraction and Aggregation\n",
    "This notebook provides a robust tool for extracting specific 3D variables (such as wind speed and direction) from PALM (Potsdam Atmospheric Large-Eddy Simulation Model) NetCDF output files. It offers functionality to perform temporal aggregation (e.g., calculating hourly averages) on these variables and then saves the processed, aggregated data into new NetCDF files. This process is essential for reducing data size and preparing variables for further analysis and visualization."
