CoKLIMAx-II Jupyter Notebooks

.. _einfuehrung-jupyter:

Welcome to the resource library of the CoKLIMAx-II project. Here, we have developed and made available a variety of Jupyter Notebooks to help you get started with working on large datasets.

Jupyter Notebooks are interactive tools that seamlessly integrate code, data analysis, and documentation. They provide an ideal platform for processing complex datasets, such as the climate datasets from the Copernicus Climate Data Store (CDS), and for utilizing them in your daily work. In the context of urban administration, such datasets can play a crucial role in the future. Whether it's monitoring climate impacts, planning infrastructure, or adapting to climate change, Jupyter Notebooks can support you in tackling these challenges effectively.

The digital resources developed and provided as part of the CoKLIMAx-II project can be used without extensive prior knowledge of data processing. Our Notebooks are designed to be flexible and expandable, so you can adapt them to your specific needs.

Have you already prepared your computer for working with the Jupyter resources? If not, first refer to the chapter :ref:`Required Software and Knowledge <software-to-run-jupyter>`.
