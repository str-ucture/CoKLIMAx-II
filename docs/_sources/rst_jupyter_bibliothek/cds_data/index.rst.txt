In this section, we provide a selection of interactive Jupyter Notebooks for working with datasets from the **Copernicus Climate Data Store (CDS)**. The Climate Data Store offers a comprehensive collection of **high-quality climate data**, which can be applied in **environmental analysis, urban planning, and climate impact research**.

The notebooks available here offer **step-by-step demonstrations** on how to efficiently **retrieve, process, and analyze** these datasets. They are designed for both **scientific studies** and **practical applications**, helping cities and municipalities better understand climate-related challenges and make informed decisions.
