About CoKLIMAx-II Notebooks
===========================

Welcome to the resource library of the CoKLIMAx-II project. Here we have developed and made available numerous Jupyter Notebooks that can make it easier for you to get started working with large data sets.

Jupyter Notebooks are interactive tools that allow you to seamlessly combine code, data analysis and documentation. They provide an ideal platform for processing complex data sets, such as the climate data sets from the Copernicus Climate Data Store (CDS), and using them in your daily work. In the urban administration context, such data sets can play a crucial role in the future. Whether it is monitoring climate impacts, planning infrastructure or adapting to climate change - Jupyter Notebooks can support you in your work to effectively address these challenges.

You can use the digital resources developed and made available within the CoKLIMAx-II project even without extensive prior knowledge of data processing. Our notebooks have been designed to be flexible and expandable so that you can adapt them to your specific needs.

Have you already prepared your computer to work with the Jupyter resources? If not, first skip to the chapter :ref:`Required Software and Knowledge <software-knowledge>`.

All notebooks are divided into two categories and can be found here:

* :ref:`CDS Dataset Notebooks <cds-dataset-notebooks>`
* :ref:`Satellite Data Notebooks <satellite-data-notebooks>`
* :ref:`Visualization Options Library <visualization-options-library>`
