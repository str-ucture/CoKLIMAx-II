===================
The Course Elements
===================

Our documentation is divided into **course elements**, providing a structured and easy-to-follow introduction to working with Jupyter Notebooks. The course elements are designed to help you:

* Develop clearly defined learning objectives, giving you an overview of what you should have achieved by the end of each unit.
* Follow step-by-step instructions to walk you through the necessary tools.
* Complete practical exercises to test and reinforce your learning at the end of each unit.

This structure ensures that you develop a solid understanding and can immediately apply what you have learned. Whether you are just starting or already have experience, our course elements offer a systematic approach to building your knowledge and expanding your skills.

Within our course modules, we have prepared learning notebooks that guide you step by step. The key learning objectives in the course elements include:

* **Opening and setting up** a Jupyter Notebook on your local computer.
* **Retrieving data**: Download data directly from the Copernicus Climate Data Store (CDS).
* **Processing data**: Transform and modify raw data to make it usable for specific applications.
* **Exporting data**: Prepare the data in formats that can be directly processed in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) like QGIS or ArcGIS.

Each element builds on the previous one, so we recommend working through the content step by step. Dive in and discover how Jupyter Notebooks can help you develop data competency for your urban administration projects!

Have you already prepared your computer for the course resources? If not, start with the chapter :ref:`Required Software and Knowledge <software-to-run-jupyter>`. Otherwise, you can proceed directly to Course 1: :ref:`Element 1 <kurs1-element1>`.

If you already have experience with Jupyter Notebooks and are using them on your laptop, feel free to browse through the :ref:`Library <einfuehrung-jupyter>`.
