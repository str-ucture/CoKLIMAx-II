.. _cds:

The Copernicus Climate Data Store (CDS) is a comprehensive online platform that provides access to a wide range of climate data and services. As part of the European Union's Copernicus program, the CDS is designed to support users with high-quality data and information for analyzing, monitoring, and adapting to climate change. The platform and its content are freely available and cater to both professionals in science and administration as well as interested laypersons.

The CDS database includes historical climate data, current observations, and model forecasts. It covers a wide variety of topics, including temperature, precipitation, wind conditions, sea level, greenhouse gas emissions, and much more. This information is sourced from various origins, including satellite data, in-situ measurements, and numerical climate models. Additionally, the CDS provides access to "reanalyses," where past climate data are homogenized and reinterpreted using modern models and techniques to better understand long-term trends and patterns.

With its diverse resources, the Copernicus Climate Data Store helps decision-makers make informed choices to adapt to the challenges of climate change and act sustainably.

For urban decision-makers, the data from the CDS provides a crucial foundation for proactively addressing the challenges of climate change. With precise and up-to-date information on climate trends and extreme events such as heat waves, heavy rainfall, or flooding, cities can better assess their climate risks and develop data-driven adaptation strategies. CDS data enables the optimization of urban planning processes, such as identifying heat islands, planning climate-resilient infrastructure, or improving water management. Furthermore, the data also supports compliance with legal requirements and international climate goals by providing robust data foundations for reporting and sustainability strategies. By utilizing CDS resources, cities can make well-informed decisions and promote sustainable development that meets the needs of current and future generations.
