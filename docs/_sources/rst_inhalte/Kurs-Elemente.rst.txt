===================
The Course Elements
===================

Our documentation is divided into **course elements**, providing a structured and easily understandable introduction to working with Jupyter Notebooks. The course elements are designed so that you:

 * Develop clearly defined learning objectives, giving you an overview of what you should have achieved by the end of each unit.
 * Receive step-by-step instructions to guide you through the necessary tools.
 * Work through practical tasks that test and solidify your knowledge at the end of each unit.

This structure ensures that you develop a solid understanding and can immediately apply what you’ve learned. Whether you’re just starting or already have experience, our course elements provide a structured path to build your knowledge and systematically enhance your skills.

Within our course modules, we have prepared learning notebooks that provide you with step-by-step guidance. The overarching learning objectives in the course elements include:

 * Opening and designing a Jupyter Notebook on your local computer
 * Data retrieval: Download data directly from the Copernicus Climate Data Store.
 * Data processing: Transform and modify raw data to make it usable for specific applications.
 * Data export: Prepare the data in formats that can be directly processed in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) like QGIS or ArcGIS.

Each element builds on the previous one, so we recommend working through the content step by step. Dive in and discover how Jupyter Notebooks can help you develop data competency for your urban administration projects! Have you already prepared your computer for the course resources? If not, start with the chapter :ref:`Required Software and Knowledge <software-to-run-jupyter>`. Otherwise, you can proceed directly to Course 1: :ref:`Element 1 <kurs1-element1>`.

If you already have experience with Jupyter Notebooks and are using them on your laptop, feel free to browse through the :ref:`library <einfuehrung-jupyter>`.
